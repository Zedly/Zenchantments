# Zenchantments

## Description

Zenchantments is a custom enchantment plugin that adds 70+ new enchantments to the game, covering a multitude of
different uses. These include target-tracing arrows, lumber axes, block-breaking lasers, and much more. These custom
enchantments are obtained through the normal enchantment process and act like regular enchantments, capable of being
combined and merged. The plugin requires no client-side mods or resource packs. A comprehensive configuration file
enables fine-tuning of individual enchantments to tailor them to every server's gameplay.

## Download

See [Releases](https://github.com/Zedly/Zenchantments/releases) for downloads.

## Compile

To compile the entire project yourself, you need multiple versions of CraftBukkit as Maven repositories. These are
created automatically when you use [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) to obtain CB and/or Spigot.
If you are making a private build and only need support for one server version, you can easily add and remove
compatibility adapters by editing the parent POM and a switch in PlayerInteractUtil.

## Compatibility

The current version of this plugin is fully compatible with CraftBukkit and Spigot versions 1.10.x, 1.11.x and 1.12.
Other versions have partial support through Bukkit-only fallback code, but integration with protection and logging
plugins will be limited.
